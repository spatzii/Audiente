# Known bugs:

- line 36 in Home.py, use try/except to catch error when default 'SelecteazÄƒ tronsonul' option is entered in the selectbox.
    Otherwise, it throws error because there is no dictionary entry for 'Selecteaza tronsonul'. Can be fixed
- slot_ratings_for_graph_by_minute in data throws error when selecting '2:00 - 6:00' for graph because Minute ratings doesn't
    provide data. Needs something like 'if data exists...'
- Function in data/xlsx_to_csv_quarters() doesn't catch missing columns in rating files, it uses exceptions to overcome this.
    Code has to be rewritten with 'loc' instead of 'iloc' and a method


# To improve:

- line 46 in data: more concise filename generator, using f-strings
- Home.py, lines 10/14: Needs simple method to get file names in folders for Minutes or Quarters
